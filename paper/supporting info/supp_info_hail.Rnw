\section*{Description of recent high-loss hail events in Australia}

\subsection*{``Hailoween''}

The 31 October 2020 ``Hailoween'' hail storm generated a series of at least nine
supercells in a corridor from Amberley to Logan, Queensland \cite<unless
otherwise noted, details here are sourced from>{AIDR_2021}. The cells generated
giant hail stones reported as 7 cm in Gympie, up to 14 cm at Forestdale, 13 cm
at Hillcrest, 9.5 cm at Amberley, 8 cm at Springfield, 7 cm at Gatton, and 5 cm
at Seventeen Mile Rocks. The hardest hit suburbs were Springfield, Springfield
Lakes, Rosewood, and Willowbank. Strong winds were also recorded, with 100 km
h$^{-1}$ gusts occurring around Moreton Bay, and wind damage evident from
Redcliffe to Kingston. The State Emergency Service received over 2,900 callouts
and power outages affected 95,000 homes. The storms were associated with a
series of complex fronts and embedded lows in the monsoon inland trough,
following a week of instability over eastern Australia \cite{BOM_2020,
BOM_2024}. The Queensland Reconstruction Authority (QRA)â€™s initial assessment
found 520 severely damaged properties, 602 moderately damaged properties and 652
properties with minor damage \cite{Ipswich_2021}. Extensive damage was reported
to roofs, skylights, solar panels, interiors, awnings, windows, shutters,
including ceiling collapse and fallen trees (pers. comm. J. Aldridge 2024).
Water ingress following hail damage was widespread, leading to damage to
interior walls and floors, mold, and contents damage (pers. comm. J. Aldridge
2024). Some houses experienced hail damage through the roof and interior ceiling
and into the living areas of the home \cite{ABC_2020b}. This event resulted in
an insured loss of \$A1.056b from around 44,700 claims \cite{ICA_2024}.

\subsection*{Tri-city storms}

The 18-20th January 2020 ``tri-city'' storms impacted a wide area of eastern
Australia immediately following the devastating ``Black Summer'' bushfires
\cite<unless otherwise noted, details here are sourced from the>{AIDR_2020}. The
storms impacted three major cities: Canberra, Sydney, and Melbourne, as well as
country New South Wales areas of Queanbeyan and Goulburn \cite{ICA_2024}.
Canberra received 4--6 cm hail which impacted the central business district and
densely populated inner suburbs including the Australian National University. A
117 km h$^{-1}$ wind gust was recorded at Canberra Airport. The extensive damage
in Canberra included broken windows and skylights in homes and commercial
buildings, flooding, and thousands of cars damaged by hailstones. Wind damage
included fallen trees, branches and power lines, and blocked roads. There was
damage to buildings at the Australian National University and in the central
business district \cite{ABC_2020c}. Melbourne received hail of up to 5.5 cm over
the southeastern suburbs, and there were damaging winds, heavy rainfall and
flash flooding across broader regions. Sydney received large hail over the outer
southern suburbs around Campbelltown \cite{ABC_2020d}. The meteorological
situation showed an inland trough extending from central Queensland through
southeastern Australia, with an upper level low and associated surface level low
creating moist unstable air \cite{BOM_2024}. In total, this event resulted in
around 132,000 claims and a \$A1.68b insured loss \cite{ICA_2024}.

\subsection*{Rockhampton hailstorm}

The 19 April 2020 hailstorm \cite{ABC_2020, EWN_2020, Swissre_2021} impacted the
central Queensland towns of Rockhampton and Yeppoon and surrounding areas
\cite{ABC_2020} located near the Tropic of Capricorn. The weather pattern was
due to an upper-level trough crossing central Queensland, combined with a
surface trough \cite{EWN_2020}. Storm activity propagated from inland moving
northeast to the coast \cite{EWN_2020}, with a large supercell impacting the
corridor from Rockhampton to Yeppoon. Giant hail of up to 12 cm was reported
\cite{EWN_2020}, as well as 100 km h$^{-1}$ wind gusts \cite{ABC_2020}. Damage
included holes in roofs, smashed windows and car windscreens, and tree damage
\cite{ABC_2020}. The timing of this event during the first Covid lockdown
complicated recovery efforts \cite{AFR_2020}. An insured loss of \$A503m from
around 15,000 claims was incurred \cite{ICA_2024}. In the Whitsunday region,
golf ball size hail was reported in Sarina \cite{EWN_2020}. The time of year,
size of hail and the tropical latitude of this event made it highly unusual.

     values drawn from the relevant EVD(s) each time, to obtain a
     distribution of $p$ values. Bars show medians, box hinges show the
     interquartile ranges (IQRs), whiskers show the largest (smallest) values no
     more than 1.5 $\times$ IQR from the upper (lower) hinge, and points show
     outlier points beyond the whisker ranges. The red horizontal line shows $p

    confidence intervals. Maximum hail sizes are fitted with Generalized Pareto
    models that have no location parameter. Maximum hail-proximal winds are
