\section{Introduction}

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Simulations of historical and projected weather}

Historical and future simulations were produced using the Advanced Research Weather Research and Forecasting (AR-WRF) weather model version 4.4.1 \cite{Skamarock_2021} for four nested domains covering major Australian cities. We used one coarse- ($\sim$27 km grid spacing), two medium- ($\sim$9 km), and four fine-resolution ($\sim$3 km) domains with a parent-child scaling ratio of three. The model domains are shown in Figure \ref{fig:domains} and parameterisation schemes used are shown in Table \ref{tab:schemes}. The timestep for the coarse domain was set to 100 s, but reduced to 80 s or 60 s for simulation days on which Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) errors occurred \todo{see comment in Section \ref{sec:results}}. WRF-HAILCAST \cite{Adams-Selin_WF_2019} was enabled for the fine-resolution domains, to estimate maximum hailstone diameters at the surface between each hourly output. Simulations were run for two scenarios of 20 convective seasons each: the historical scenario ran from 1989 to 2009, and the future scenario from 2080 to 2100. For each convective season, simulations were run from September 30 to February 28 inclusive, with hourly output resolution, and the first 24 hours of each season were discarded as model spin-up time. Boundary condition inputs were prepared using the \texttt{nc2wrf} code of \citeA{Xu_code_data_2021}.

\subsection{Data preprocessing}

\subsection{Statistical modelling of extreme values}

Modelling of extreme values was done using the R \cite{R_software} package \texttt{extRemes} \cite{Gilleland_JSS_2016}. Block maxima were defined as daily maximum hailstone size per domain, under the assumption that such a timeseries would be close to \todo{IID} given that a single hail storm would never last more than one day.  

\section{Data}

Boundary conditions for the simulations were provided by bias-corrected data for downscaling by \citeA{Xu_SD_2021}. These boundary conditions have a mean climate and interannual variance derived from European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis 5 \cite<ERA5,>{Hersbach_QJRMS_2020}, with a non-linear trend derived from the ensemble mean of 18 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 \cite<CMIP6,>{Eyring_GMD_2016} models \cite{Xu_SD_2021}. Future projections used the ``middle-of-the-road'' SSP2-4.5 shared socioeconomic pathway \cite<SSP,>{ONeill_GEC_2017}.
